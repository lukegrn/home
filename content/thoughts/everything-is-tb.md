I just[^1] finished reading _Everything is Tuberculosis_ by John Green. It is a
book about why, and how, a curable, infectious disease, is also still the
world's deadliest.

I won't spoil anything here, but _Everything is Tuberculosis_ is heartbreaking,
compelling, and pointedly exposes the corporate greed that actively kills the
poor and vulnerable around the world. It does indeed point out that curing
everyone afflicted with TB is a complicated challenge, and that medicine
availability is only one such issue that needs to be solved. However, none of
the problems are unsolvable, and it is only active choices made by those with
the power to solve these problems that has created the moment in time so many
find themselves in; with an available cure, and no means (be it transportation,
money, or cultural barriers) to receive it.

These facts are interwoven with the story of a young man named Henry, a TB
patient in Sierra Leone. Henry exemplifies so many of these barriers and his
story puts a face to a lot of statistics. His story is compelling,
heartbreaking, joyful, and so much more.

[^1]: Well, just is generous. I finished it like a month ago.
