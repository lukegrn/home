Here are some things I am trying to stop using, why, and what I've replaced them
with; if they should be replaced. Some of them are for health reasons, moral
reasons, or privacy reasons. I am not claiming that this is the perfect way to
satisfy any of those goals, just what I am working on right now.

## Social Media

### Instagram

In its infancy, Instagram was pretty cool and was a fun way to see photos of
what your friends were doing. Now it is some weird combination of
Algorithm-served short videos designed to grab my attention, and the rare post
from a friend from a week ago.

I use(d) Instagram for two very different puposes. I have a wildlife photography
account that serves as a portfolio of sorts, and I have a personal accout that
had the goal of keeping up with my friends. I will have two different sections
of alternatives for these two distinct purposes.

#### Alternatives (socially)

-   **Instagram**: I've turned off suggested content[^1], which only shows me
    things from people I follow. As well as only use Instagram in the browser.
    But this is imperfect as the Algorithm is terrible at showing me what I
    want, and great at showing me what will keep me on the app as long as
    possible.

-   **Talk to your friends**: It seems absurd that I have to even write this.
    But everything Instagram promises in terms of social interaction, can be
    done by talking to your friends.

    -   Ask them how their trip was
    -   Send them pictures of cool things that happened to you
    -   Just like, be their friend

#### Alternatives (photography)

-   **[Flickr](https://flickr.com)**: I really like Flickr. It has somehow
    survived the Algorithmization of social media. It is simple, serves as a
    place to post my photos and looks at others whose work inspires me.

-   **This site**: I will likely add a portfolio section to show some of my
    favorite work on this site.

-   **Make projects**: I am hoping to start making physical projects of cohesive
    photos I take.

-   **Read/view projects**: Go to your library - they have loads of photo books
    to check out. Specifically from old renowned photographers who you won't see
    on the internet.

### Reddit

The more I use Reddit, the more I think I should just stop. Redditors are a meme
for a reason, and you can get news and interact with communities of interest
(see Flickr above) in other places. In these alternatives I'll focus on the
link-aggregation nature of Reddit.

#### Alternatives

-   **An RSS feed**: After reading
    [this article](https://www.staygrounded.online/p/a-well-curated-feed-reader-is-a-wonderful?utm_source=publication-search)
    I have wanted to set up an RSS feed of things I would usually look for on
    Reddit. If I do, I'll update this to reflect how that experience has been.

-   **Local new sites**: I used Reddit a lot to see what was going on in my
    local area. Luckily, this was solved in eternity past by _the newspaper_.
    Unfortunately, here, they only circulate monthly but all have real websites
    that stay up to date with local news.

## Entertainment

### YouTube

I don't have much of a problem with comsumption-based entertainment. I think
that TV, movies, and even something like YouTube can have its place. I think
that the real problem, of which YouTube has also fallen into, is _passive_
consumption. With autoplay, shorts, Algorithm-driven suggestions, etc, it is
really easy to passively watch. These alternatives will focus on active
consumption instead.

#### Alternatives

-   **[Freetube](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube)**: This is a YouTube
    client that allows you to turn off all suggestions. I have mine configured
    to show the newest videos from channels I subscribe to. It does not show
    shorts, and it does not show recommendations. It also, theoretically is more
    private. I haven't done loads of reasearch on that, but currently YouTube is
    the only thing tying me to Google. Unfortunately, it also seems to be capped
    to 1080p playback, which is unfortunate.

-   **Add channels to your RSS feed**: I don't do this, namely because I don't
    have an RSS feed, but I would love to get to a point where I have
    RSS+something like youtube-dl[^2] to watch videos locally.

### Streaming services

I am currently dependent on Spotify for my music, and TV streaming services for
movies and TV. However, I would love to start buying physical copies of music,
tv, and movies. Though, that is extremely expensive, so who knows if I will do
it.

## Shopping

### Amazon

I really don't like using Amazon, and honestly only get a few things there
periodically. I should probably cancel my Prime membership. Amazon is
anti-competitive, and treats their employees particularly bad. I would rather
not support a business like that.

#### Alternatives

**Shop locally**: This is the best option. When I have the option, I always try
to shop at a locally owned store.

**Shop at real stores**: Sometimes local stores may not have what I want, in
that case I try to shop at a real store, even if it is a chain.

**Order from other online sources**: If I can't buy something in person, I would
rather order from a different online store than Amazon. For example, I buy
camera gear almost exclusively from [B&H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/) (new)
and [MPB](https://www.mpb.com/) (used).

### Kindle

For the same reasons as Amazon

#### Alternatives

**Real books**: Your local library will literally give you books for free. Go
get them.

**Other E-Readers**: I have a pocketbook E-Reader that I love, but any brand
that supports books _not_ purchased through the Kindle store is great.

### Misc Programs

Lots of things to put here, so I'll try and keep it short and sweet.

-   **Adobe Lightroom**: I really want to use
    [Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) because its free, open-source, and
    AI-free. But I haven't been able to get it to work well enough for me.

-   **Windows**: I use a Mac at home, but would really prefer to use Linux[^3].
    Apple definitely has its own anti-compete issues that I would rather not
    support. However, Lightroom doesn't run on Linux, and Apple cares
    significantly more about my privacy than Windows.

-   **G-Mail**: It's _so_ easy to use a different email provider. Specifically,
    I choose one I have to pay for[^4], as they are much more likely to value my
    privacy. Its also easy to set it up to use this domain.

-   **Google search**: Google search has gotten worse, and they are adding AI
    summaries which I am not interested in. I use
    [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com).

-   **VSCode**: Microsoft classicly has a parasitic relationship with
    open-source, and I expect the same for VSCode eventually. Neovim is perfect
    for my use case.

-   **Google Chrome**: I use Firefox.

    I have to do this every thirty days, and only from the app, so that's
    annoying and definitely maliciously designed by Meta.
