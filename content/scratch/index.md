## Things I want to read

- [The Age of Surveillance Capitalism](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism)
- ~~[Everything is Tuberculosis](https://everythingistb.com/)~~ thoughts
  [here](/thoughts/everything-is-tb)

- ~~[The Future is Federated ](https://elenarossini.com/2024/11/the-rebellion-will-be-federated/)~~

## Projects I want to do

- A quick-logger for this page. Maybe a phone app that can auto-add entries to
  this
- Advent of code 2024
    - This is in progress [here](https://github.com/lukegrn/advent24)
    - Note: Advent of Code is not a showcase of _good_ code. I've let that
      prevent me from completing it in the past. This year I am making it work,
      and moving on.
